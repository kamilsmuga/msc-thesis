\begin{abstract}

\emph{ /* To be revised. */} \par
\textsl{New Infrastructure as a Service solutions are becoming available with a growing number of supported pricing models. More often than not, a hosted Cloud environment is used to design and build an infrastructure for a product. The recent availability of different pricing schemes based on resource utilization and uptime reveals new challenges in already unpredictable capacity planning process. There is a choice between ad-hoc provisioning and upfront payments with reduced hourly rates. Reserved instances charged upfront are categorized into three groups: light, medium and heavy. Which one is better for a given utilization model? When exactly does one pricing scheme becomes more cost effective? Determining which machine type is better for a given utilization model, or at which point the cost effectiveness of a pricing scheme changes, is vital for the companies subscribing to the IaaS. }

\section{Taxonomy}

\subsection{Upfront cost}

Investment in compute resources comes with upfront cost. In case of physical machine it is hardware or lease cost. For virtual resources, IaaS providers offer per hour discounts for upfront charged schemes. \par
Upfront cost is considered to be one time payment and will be represented by \textit{u}. 

\subsection{Cost per hour}

Cost per hour represents a total cost of running a single machine divided by number of hours in calendar year. Aggregated cost is relatively easy to calculate in rented, virtualised environments. IaaS providers usually charge an X amount per hour. It might vary based on total uptime per month or pricing scheme. This number will be considered as a partial cost per hour and defined as \textit{pcph}. \par
Cost of running of physical hardware is less straightforward to calculate as it includes: power consumption, operations, hardware replacements cost, data center related costs and many others that may vary based on individual cases. Although more troublesome to calculate, cost per hour per host for physical infrastructure is possible to calculate. \par
Cost per hour will be defined as \textit{cph}. It includes upfront cost and IaaS provider per hour charges. It is defined as a function of hours of utilization per day.  

\begin{equation}
cph(h) = \frac{u + \sum_{i=1}^{366} pcph \times h}{365 \times h}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Intersection points between pricing schemes}

Cost per hour is calculated for each of available pricing schemes. Single result represents a matrix of hours per day and \textit{cph}. Graphical representation of results produces a graph similar to Figure~\ref{fig:cc2_8xlarge}. \par 
This representation allows to notice pricing trends. In the example below, price drops exponentially for around first 5 hours of usage and nearly stabilizes afterwards. Light is the cheapest option for around 15 hours per day usage. This is better visible on Figure~\ref{fig:cph_cc2_8xlarge_zoom}. After 15 hours, it is better to invest in Heavy utilization scheme. This is the point that will be called \textit{an intersection point} between 2 pricing schemes and noted as \textit{ip(scheme1, scheme2)}. \par
For the example below, cc2.8xlarge instance's intersection point between Light and Heavy schemes is \textit{ip(light, heavy) = 16}.

        9,Memory capacity,FLOAT,YES

\subsubsection{Daily metrics aggregation}

\paragraph{Calculate uptime per machine}

\paragraph{Calculate number of jobs per day}
Input: Job id per machine \textless K, List\textless V\textgreater\textgreater

Output: Job count per machine \textless K,V\textgreater

\paragraph{Calculate cluster averages for aggregations}
Input: Aggregated CPU, memory and number of tasks per machine per day \textless K, List\textless V\textgreater\textgreater

\paragraph{Calculate distance from optimality points based on uptime}
Input: Machine uptime per day

Output: Distance from optimality points. Might be positive or negative. 

\subsection{Recognize inefficiencies and suggest changes}

\subsubsection{Threshold based report}

Generate report of machines based on distance from optimality points. Use customizable threshold. 
Results from the report will be used to calculate suggestions.

\subsubsection{Visual recognition}

Visual recognition as a helper method to define thresholds, especially for further incremental optimizations. 
Useful as static thresholds can miss a whole set of machines that are just below the threshold. 

\begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/cubism}
        \caption{Visualization of distance from optimality points. Green - positive, Blue - negative values.}
        \label{fig:cubism}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Squeeze-them-in suggestion strategy}

Input: results of the Threshold based report. 

Computation: Calculate spare capacity based on average CPU and memory usage. Iterate through a pool of available machines (not included in input report) and advertise available capacity only if CPU and memory usage is lower than average. Aggregate spare capacity results.

Output: List of machines that can be shutdown based on computed spare-capacity.

\subsubsection{New capacity configuration suggestion}

Input: results of the Threshold based report.

Computation: Compute a minimal number of VMs for each configuration based on requested capacity

Output: A number and configuration of the cheapest computed configuration.
